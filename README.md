## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
To duplicate this project, you will need to get an API key from Location IQ and install a .env file. It is recommended that you add the file to your .gitignore to keep the key private.

## Architecture
This application was built using html, JavaScript and CSS, primarily in the React framework, as well as React-BootStrap, AXIOS, and the Location IQ API

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
